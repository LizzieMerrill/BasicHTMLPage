    <h1><strong>My Five Favorite Phoenix Restaurants</strong></h1>
    <p>
        Below is a list of my favorite restaurants in all of Phoenix. <br> Some
        of them are pretty niche, like Jewel's Cafe (my favorite restaurant of all time), <br>
        and I like all of them for different reasons. But you should give them a go! <br><br>
        <b>Jewel's Cafe</b> is catered to people who eat gluten free but still tastes amazing, <br> 
        <b>2 Fat Guys Grilled Cheese</b> is just super good food for a small business, <br>
        <b>Snakes and Lattes</b> is for a fun night out with friends at a board game cafe, <br>
        <b>Alien Donuts</b> has super yummy desserts such as milkshakes and donuts, and <br>
        <b>Barrio Cafe</b> has all sorts of authentic, amazing-tasting Mexican food!<br><br>

        Welp, enjoy these fresh picks on your next trip to Phoenix!
